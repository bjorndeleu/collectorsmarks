      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Collectorsmarks.org is an independent, research-driven initiative
        focused on the study and documentation of collectors’ marks on works on
        paper. The project builds on the monumental catalogue of collectors’
        marks compiled by Frits Lugt, while also taking into account new
        discoveries, updated attributions, and the needs of contemporary
        provenance research.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim is not to replace the Lugt catalogue, but to complement it with
        structured data, visual documentation, and references to archival
        sources. In doing so, the platform hopes to support curators, scholars,
        dealers, and private collectors in reconstructing the history of
        ownership of drawings and prints.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, the platform concentrates on marks that appear on European
        works on paper from the early modern period to the twentieth century.
        Over time, the scope may expand, depending on the availability of
        reliable documentation and the interests of collaborating researchers.
      </p>

      <h3>Project status</h3>
      <p>
        At this stage, Collectorsmarks.org should be regarded as a work in
        progress. The database is still experimental, and many functions are
        under active development. Provisional entries, uncertainties, and gaps
        are part of the research process and will be clearly indicated wherever
        possible.
