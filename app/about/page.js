<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Collectorsmarks.org is an independent digital initiative focused on the study and documentation of collectors’ marks. 
The platform builds on the monumental work of Frits Lugt while incorporating newly discovered marks, 
updated attributions, and modern provenance methodologies. 
The project is developed in collaboration with researchers, archives, and institutions engaged in the history of collecting.
