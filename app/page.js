      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Collectorsmarks.org is a digital research platform dedicated to
        collectors’ marks on works on paper. Building on the foundational work
        of Frits Lugt, the project brings together historical catalogues,
        archival sources, and new discoveries in provenance research.
      </p>

      <p>
        In its current early phase, the site offers a small set of sample
        records and basic information pages. Over time, it will grow into a
        structured database and reference tool for scholars, curators, dealers,
        and private collectors.
      </p>
