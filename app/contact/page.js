      <p>
        Collectorsmarks.org is currently in an early development phase. A
        dedicated contact address and submission form for new marks and
        corrections will be added as the project evolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the meantime, researchers, curators, dealers, and collectors who are
        interested in provenance research or in contributing information about
        collectors’ marks are warmly invited to get in touch. The preferred
        channels for contact will be listed here in due course.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are planning to cite the project, or if you would like to discuss
        potential collaborations, please include a brief description of your
        research interests and how collectors’ marks relate to your work.
