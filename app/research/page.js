      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        Collectors’ marks sit at the intersection of connoisseurship, the
        history of collecting, and provenance research. They provide crucial
        evidence for reconstructing the ownership, circulation, and reception of
        works on paper across time and geography.
      </p>

      <p>
        The research associated with Collectorsmarks.org focuses on several
        interrelated strands:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Documenting marks:</strong> recording the appearance, variants,
          and technical characteristics of collectors’ stamps and inscriptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Revising attributions:</strong> reviewing existing entries in
          the Lugt catalogue in light of new archival or photographic evidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provenance case studies:</strong> tracing the movement of
          individual drawings and prints through historical collections and
          sales.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contextual research:</strong> investigating the collectors and
          institutions behind the marks, their networks, and collecting
          practices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Future updates to this section will include short essays, case studies,
        and references to publications and archival sources. Collaborative
        projects with academic and museum partners are very welcome.
